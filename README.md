S plus mobile network architecture is the evolution of the current mobile network architecture in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization context. The a functional validation setup to show the working of S+ MN architecture, application oriented forwarding of IP traffic through the use of distributed IP anchors and select the right one for use in the following cases. i) The MU acts as a server and requires a static IP address for incoming IP flows. Static anchoring at the initial router will be required. ii) No fixed IP address, i.e. the MU acts as client, but IP session continuity: No static anchoring at the Initial router will be required. iii) No fixed IP address and no IP session continuity: no static anchoring at the Initial router will be required.
